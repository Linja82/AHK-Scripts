# Page Up/Down to Tab Shifting
This AHK script remaps your PgUp/PgDn keys to Ctrl + PgUp / Ctrl + PgDn if you're in a browser.

## Supported Browsers
My script only detects a few browsers:
- Brave
- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- Opera

However, it's really easy to add a new browser or app by adding the name to the BrowserList array. You can enable the WinGetTitle function that's been mapped to the Left Window key to find the name of the active window.
